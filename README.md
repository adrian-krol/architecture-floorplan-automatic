# Architectural Floor Plan Analysis and Recognition System
AFPARS is an architectural floor plan analysis and recognition system to create extended plans for building services.

##Â Description
The aim of the project is to be a software that automatically detects room geometries and thus intrinsically continuously records the necessary polygons. The software reads plans as DXF / DWG a calculated polygons and exported it back as DXF / DWG. To calculate the polygons various geometrical methods, as well as an extensible library to be used by architectural elements.
